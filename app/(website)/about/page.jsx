						As a conference accredited by THIMUN Foundation, the Mediterranean Model United Nations (MEDIMUN) holds a venerable status, duly recognized by the governing institution
						that endorses Model United Nations conferences globally. MEDIMUN was established in the year 2006 under the auspices of The English School and has since served as an
						educational platform of considerable repute. It enables young scholars to deepen their understanding not merely of specific nation-states, but also of the intricate
						operations of the United Nations through immersive, experiential learning. These academic pursuits are facilitated and scrupulously overseen by esteemed Directors, who
						are commonly educators affiliated with the students' respective educational institutions. These Directors bear the weighty responsibility of instructing the delegates
						in the nuances of the United Nations' formal 'Parliamentary Procedures.' This stewardship ensures that the debates and deliberations are conducted within a framework
						that is both structured and professionally dignified. Further amplifying its significance, MEDIMUN enjoys the distinction of being the most expansive and
						longest-running Model United Nations conference in Cyprus. Administered under the aegis of a non-profit organizational structure, the conference is orchestrated by a
						dedicated cadre of both student and educator volunteers. These individuals altruistically invest their time and intellectual resources to guarantee the event's
						continued success and scholarly impact.

						securing placement at either Oxford, Cambridge, or esteemed medical schools. The school's head is an esteemed member of the United Kingdom Headmasters' Conference,
						underscoring the institution's adherence to traditional and academic cultural norms. The institutional motto, "Non sibi sed scholae," encapsulates the ethos of
						community-first, emphasizing that students should take pride in their membership within the school community and prioritize collective needs above individual desires.
