However, we want to assure you that any future additions of these features will rectify this issue, ensuring that all previous announcements display the proper and intended results. Therefore, you are encouraged to utilize these features with the exception of emails, as any emails sent cannot be altered.\r\n' +

      'Additionally, we regret to inform you that tables are currently unsupported in emails. However, we are actively working towards enabling this feature in future updates. Furthermore, we are pleased to announce that attachments will be supported in all announcements in the near future. In the interim, you can upload files to the documents section and reference them accordingly. Once implemented, these files will be directly visible within the announcements and will also be sent along with the emails.\r\n' +
